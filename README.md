# Satellite-Simulation
Physics project done by two students in almost 4 days for a Damascus University project


## Description 
A physical simualation for the movement of satallites in orbit in relation to earth done for a university project.
using JavaScript and three.js for the graphical output and physical calculations and lil.gue for the control interface.


## Code Classes
the main components of the source are:

### ArrowsAndTrails.js
for a graphical representation of the affecting forces and the orbit of the satellite

### Constants.js
includes all the physical constants needed for the simulation

### Environment.js
includes all functions that relate to rendering and output of the environment with its planet, sun, moon and stars skybox.

###  GUI.js
pretty much self explanatory.

### main.js
the main deal, houses all of the physical calculations neede for the simulation.

huge thanks to @[IyadAlanssary](https://github.com/IyadAlanssary) for his efforts in making the code clean

## How to run the project (for now)
make sure you have node.js installed and install three.js with
```
npm install three
```
and run the project to local host with
```
npm run dev
```

the main controls of the sim are all through the provided GUI.


we will try and deliver a web hosted instant-try version asap

## This project was made with the efforts of my partner @[IyadAlanssary](https://github.com/IyadAlanssary) and me @[RedWn](https://github.com/RedWn)
thx to @[tarook0](https://github.com/tarook0), @[Hamsho](https://github.com/Hamsho) and @[Maias-Alakramy](https://github.com/Maias-Alakramy) for additional help

## How to help?
this is pretty much our very first try in webGL and JS and we welcome any criticism, help, tips or any way we can improve our skills

## As for the license 
we hope this project will deliver some help and be of any value to anyone trying to get into three.js, physical calculations or really any subject of knowledge that we encountered here.

thx.
